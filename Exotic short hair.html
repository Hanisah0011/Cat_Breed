<h2>Exotic Short Hair</h2>

<p>The Exotic Shorthair cat is a medium sized, stocky cat breed. The head is round and broad with small wide set ears and a short open face. The eyes are large and round with brilliant colour. The legs are short, thick and strong with large round paws and tufted toes. The tail is short and bushy. The coat is short, thick and luxuriant with a dense, soft undercoat. The Exotic Shorthair cat comes in all the many Persian cat colours and coat patterns, and as spotted tabbies.</p>

<p>The Exotic Shorthair cat has the same gentle affectionate nature as it's longhaired cousins and is not as boisterous as many shorthair breeds. Exotic cats are quite happy to be left at home on their own and to lead a quiet life.</p>

<p>The Exotic Shorthair cat breed is in every way a shorthaired Persian cat breed, so much so that it is included in the longhair section of cat shows. In America selective breeding of American Shorthair cats and Persian longhairs was undertaken to produce a cat that looked like the Persian cat in every way except for the coat. In Britain, British Shorthair cats were crossed with longhaired Persian cats in the same way. The coat, which is of medium length, is much easier to care for but still has the huge range of colours and patterns. The Exotic Shorthair cat was first seen in the 1960s and is becoming a very popular cat.</p>
