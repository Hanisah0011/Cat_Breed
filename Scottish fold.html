<h2>Scottish fold</h2>
<p>The Scottish Fold is a medium-sized cat with medium sized boning. She is a very round looking cat. The head is round and the folded ears heighten that illusion of roundness. The eyes are very round, bright and clear. The legs appear round, as does the tail in comparison to its length. The short coat is easy to care for. Some registries allow a longhaired version of the Scottish Fold called the Scottish Fold Longhair. Their longer coats can vary slightly in texture, and require regular care.</p>

<p>The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. She is an easy cat to live with and to care for. She is affectionate and is comfortable with all members of her family. Her tail should be handled gently. Some of these cats are known to develop stiffness in the tail that can cause pain if it is mishandled or accidentally handled in a rough manner.</p>

<p>Care should be taken with the nutrition of the Scottish Fold. This breed has a roundness about it to begin with and she should not become overweight. She is a good eater and is not as active as other breeds, so nutritionary control is critical. The Scottish Fold needs some interactive play with her parent in order to keep in good condition. While the coat is an easy one to care for, she appreciates being brushed as part of play. As the Scottish Fold ages, play gently with the tail, moving it from side to side, and up and down. If any stiffness is noticed or if she appears to be in pain when the tail is manipulated, she should be taken to the veterinarian to make certain she is not suffering from arthritis.</p>
