<h2> British Short Hair</h2>
<p>The British Shorthair is a study in roundness. He has a large round head, round eyes and rounded paws. Even his tail has a rounded tip. He was once known as the British Blue because he came only in that color, but these days his short, plush coat comes in many different colors and patterns. There is also a longhaired variety, called the British Longhair. Except for his coat, the British Longhair is the same as the British Shorthair.</p>

<p>A British Shorthair is a dignified, intelligent and affectionate companion. He’s not generally a lapcat, but he will want to be at your side on the sofa or at least nearby. Females tend to have a serious demeanor, while males are more happy-go-lucky. These laidback cats can get along well with dogs and are calm around children, but they don’t enjoy being hauled around. Teach children to treat them with respect.</p>

<p>The British Shorthair is big, but he shouldn’t be fat. Watch his food intake to make sure he doesn’t become obese. Encourage him to chase fishing-pole toys or peacock feathers for exercise.</p>

<p>Brush or comb the British Shorthair’s coat two or three times a week to keep loose hair at a minimum. You’ll need to brush him more often in the spring when he sheds his winter coat. Trim the nails as needed and keep his ears clean.</p>

<p>The British Shorthair is well suited to any home with people who will love him. Keep him indoors to protect him from cars, diseases spread by other cats and attacks from other animals.</p>
