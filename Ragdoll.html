<h2> Ragdoll</h2>

<p>Ragdolls are large, lovable cats who are incredibly patient and gentle. Despite their imposing size, these cats are a calm and quiet breed who love nothing more than playing and cuddling with their pet parents.</p>

<p>This breed is typically easy to care for and incredibly social. They make great family pets and get along well with children. If you have the time and attention to give this fluffy kitty, she will reward you with endless loyalty and love.</p>

<p> Because ragdolls require careful breeding, they're less common than other breeds of cats. Ragdoll prices can vary from $400 for a kitten to as high as $2,000 for a show cat. The cost of your cat will depend on age and pedigree.</p>

<p>These beautiful cats are large and muscular with long hair and a soft, silky coat. Ragdolls are a low-shedding breed, but you may notice heavier seasonal shedding in the spring. The lack of an undercoat is to thank for this breed's lack of shedding, but they are not considered to be a "hypoallergenic" cat.</p>

<p>These cats stand between 9–11 inches tall and are usually 17–21 inches in length (excluding their fluffy tail). They weigh 10–20 pounds, with male ragdoll cats typically weighing more, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association.</p>

<p> According to the Ragdoll Fanciers Club, there are five types of ragdoll coat patterns: colorpoint, bicolor, mitted, lynx point, and tortie point.</p>
